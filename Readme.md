## **How to Use This Repo**
1. Each day has a folder (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.) with solutions to the problems solved on that day.
2. Each folder contains:
   - A **README.md** explaining the problem statement, approach, and complexity.
   - The **Java code** for the solution.
3. Feel free to explore and learn from the solutions!
