# **"ðŸ”¥ The Most Optimal In-Place Solution to Merge Sorted Arrays â€” No Extra Space Required! ðŸš€"**  
# Intuition
When merging two sorted arrays, we want to maintain the sorted order efficiently. The key is to avoid using extra space by leveraging the fact that the first array (`nums1`) already has enough space to accommodate all elements.

By merging the arrays from the back, we can place the largest elements in their correct positions without overwriting smaller elements.

# Approach
We use a two-pointer approach, starting from the last valid elements of both arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`). A third pointer tracks the position in `nums1` where the next element should go. 

1. Start pointers `m` and `n` at the last elements of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
2. Compare the elements pointed to by `m` and `n`.
3. Place the larger of the two at the current position (`k`) in `nums1` and move the corresponding pointer.
4. Repeat until all elements of `nums2` are placed in `nums1`.

This avoids the need for additional space and works efficiently in \(O(m + n)\) time.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**  
  \(O(m + n)\), as we traverse both arrays once.

- **Space complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\), since we modify `nums1` in-place without using extra memory.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int k = m + n - 1;
        m -= 1;
        n -= 1;
        while (n >= 0) {
            nums1[k--] = (m >= 0 && nums1[m] > nums2[n]) ? nums1[m--] : nums2[n--];
        }
    }
}
```

# Conclusion
This approach efficiently merges two sorted arrays in-place, preserving the sorted order and ensuring minimal memory usage. It highlights how we can leverage array indices and avoid unnecessary allocations for optimal performance.
